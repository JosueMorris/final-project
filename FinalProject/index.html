The need to intensify the blood alcohol controls, especially during the wee hours of the weekends, because at that time there are many young people who drive completely drunk. The consumption of alcohol is one of the main causes of accidents.This reference forces the authorities to offer peremptory answers, given the serious implications that such reality has on road safety. In many of the traffic accidents the most afflicted are innocent people, by irresponsible people who are under the influence of alcohol. We must create awareness and respect the lives of others. You are not the only one on the roads.</p>
